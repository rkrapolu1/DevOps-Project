1..There many ways to deliver the code, But I have provided one of the best method to do it so.

2.      Spin Up Cloud Formation Template Create a load balanced and Auto Scaled sample hello_world Code running on it. The application is Auto-Scaled based on the CPU utilization of the server. Notifications will be sent to the operator email address on scaling events. The instances are load balanced with a simple health check against the default web page.

3.      Use User-data scripts in CFT to Open security groups and IAM roles to be managed.

4.      Install and configure Jenkins and Docker with user data and initialize docker swarm.

5.      Write a docker file to build an image from given source code.

6.      Also install ansible and git from same docker file.

7.      Write playbook test.yml to deploy the code from docker compose file deploy.yml which creates number of replicas mentioned for high availability and hosts file.

8.      All the above scripts are stored in github.

9.      Then Jenkins jobs to be started by pulling the code from git hub and run the test.yml playbook.

10.  This will deliver the code to the container.

11.  You will have access to the code by http://localhost:5000

12.  I have attached all the above mentioned files which I have used to deliver.
